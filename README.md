# tipsy tricks
A home bar assistant that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS utilising information from the Cocktail DB and google API's.  

## The Brief

A group project to display our use of multiple API's

## Basic features include:

```
    * 
    * If a user doesn't have all of the ingredients required they can click to view a google map which displays liquor stores within a 5km radius.
        - The google map utilises a geolocation tool to first determine the location of the user
        - It then sets the map to centre on their location before populating a sidebar with liquor stores
        - The first 20 stores, and map markers will display in the sidebar, if more are available the user can click to load more
        - If the user clicks on a store in the sidebar the map will then centre on that marker.   
    * If there is saved details in the local storage from a previous use, these will populate once the page loads as buttons

```
